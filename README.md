# 📝 To-Do List Web Application

A simple and modern To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed using a circular checkbox, and delete tasks dynamically.

# 🚀 Features

➕ Add new tasks

❌ Delete tasks

✅ Mark tasks as completed with a custom circular checkbox

🎨 Modern and responsive UI

✨ Smooth animations and hover effects

📱 Responsive design (mobile friendly)

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure of the application

CSS3 – Styling, layout, animations, and custom checkbox

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – DOM manipulation and interactivity

# ⚙️ How It Works

The user types a task in the input field.

Clicking Add Task creates a new task dynamically.

Each task contains:

A circular checkbox to mark it as completed

A delete button to remove the task

Tasks are manipulated directly using JavaScript and the DOM.

# 🧠 What I Learned

DOM manipulation using createElement, innerHTML, and addEventListener

Handling events for dynamically created elements

Proper use of classes vs IDs

Building custom UI components (circular checkbox)

Structuring a small front-end project
